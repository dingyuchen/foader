# Eight Dates - John Gottman

This was a book that I believe I have read before, 
but am currently rediscovering following recent developments in my personal life.

## Conversations that Matter

Couples who are most likely to have happy marriages show the following qualities and characteristics when they talk about their relationship:

- Fondness, affection, admiration
  - Either verbally or non-verbally, the couples expresses positive affect; they emphasize the good times; they compliment their partner
- We-ness versus Separateness 
  - The couple emphasizes their ability to communicate well with each other and their mutual unity and togetherness; they don't describe themselves as separate.
- Expansiveness verses withdrawal
  - The couple describes memories about their shared past vividly and distinctly, versus vaguely or more generally with an inability to recall details.
  - They are positive and energetic talking about their relationship, versus lacking energy and enthusiasm in recalling their past
  - They express intimate information about themselves, rather than staying impersonal and guarded
- Glorifying the Struggle
  - the couple expresses pride that they have survived difficult times, versus expressing hte hopelessness of their hard times.
  - They emphasize their commitment to their relationship versus questioning whether they should really be with this partner.
  - They are proud of their relationship versus being ashamed of it.
  - They talk about their shared values, goals, and life philosophy.
  - They have intentionally created a sense of shared meaning and purpose, even in the way they move through time together.
  - They create intentional traditions in their relationship for connecting emotionally.

The positive switch is all about how couples positively _interpret_ their negative events and their partner's character,
and whether in their minds on an everyday basis they _maximize_ the positive and _minimize_ the negative (in their partner and in their relationship)

> An overall perceived negativity will quickly erode a relationship

## The Four Skills of Intimate Conversation

1. Put into words what you are feeling
2. Ask your partner open-ended questions during an intimate conversation
3. Make exploratory statements to help open up your partner's feelings and needs during an intimate conversation
4. Express tolerance, empathy, and understanding toward your partner during an intimate conversation


## Art of Listening

- Be attentive
- Be present
- Ask questions
- Tune in
- Witness
  - This means you listen so your partner doesn't feel so alone.
  - A powerful way to witness and to "be there" for your partner is to repeat back in your own words what you have heard your partner saying, and thus communicate validation.
- Avoid Judgement
  - Don't be critical and don't give advice unless your partner asks for it.
- Magnify acceptance

## Lean on Me

- Date 1 : Trust and Commitment

Trust is cherishing each other and showing your partner that you can be counted on. 

Everyday commitment, which is what trust is comprised of, means:

- You invest emotionally everything you have in this relationship
- You choose to resist possibilities with other people that will break trust in your "marriage" and you maintain boundaries with all relationships outside your marriage for the same reason
- If things are not going well, you give voice to your feelings and needs to your partner, rather than complaining to someone else
- You accept your partner as he or she is, despite flaws
- You cherish what you have and nurture gratitude
- You never threaten to leave the relationship
- You care about your partner's pain as much or even more than your own


1. Set a specific time and place to talk
2. Each partner names the feelings he or she experienced during the incident or breach in trust, without blame or criticism
3. The receiving partner listens without feedback or judgment
4. Each person describes his or her point of view about what happened during the incident without blaming or criticizing their partner, while their partner only listens and tries to empathize. The listener shouldn't bring up their own point of view until it's their turn to speak.
5. Explain and examine any feelings that were triggered by the incident but that were originally felt long before this relationship
6. Each partner assesses how they contributed to the incident and hold himself or herself accountable
7. Each apologizes and accepts the other's apology
8. You make a plan together to prevent this from happening again.

### Conversation Topic

- What does trust and commitment look like in our relationship?
- How can we make each other feel safe?
- What are our agreements about trust and commitment?

### Troubleshooting

- stay open-minded to your partner
- avoid blame
- ask your partner questions about why their beliefs about trust and commitment are important and meaningful to them
- be honest about your needs
- avoid trying to force your partner to believe what you believe when it coms to trust, loyalty, and commitment
- see your differences as opportunities to learn more about each other and create a shared value system for trust and commitment

### Open-ended Questions for Conversation

1. How did your parents show their commitment to each other? How did they show a lack of commitment to each other? In your mind, what do these things in your family history mean for the two of us?
2. What does trust mean to you?
3. Can you describe a time where you didn't feel you trusted me, and what I could have done to fix the situation?
4. What do you need from me in order for you to trust me even more?
5. What do you need from me to show that I am committed to this relationship?
6. What areas do you think we need to work on to build trust between us?
7. How are we similar and hwo are we different when it comes to trust and commitment? How can we accept these differences?

## Agree to Disagree

Date 2 : Addressing Conflict

Relationship conflict is an opportunity to get to know your partner better and to develop deeper intimacy as you talk about and work through your differences.

### Solvable Problems

These are situational problems. 
The conflict is about the topic, and there is no deeper meaning behind the position.

With solvable problems, there is a solution and this solution can be sustained.

### Perpetual Problems

These are problems that center on fundamental differences you have in your personalities or lifestyle preferences.

### Fight Fair and Repair

Process of repair when regrettable incidents happen

1. Each person takes a turn to talk about what they were feeling during the fight 
2. Each person should talk about how they saw the situation and their perspective about what actually happened in the argument
3. Triggers. 
   1. If you feel triggered, tell your partner the story of what happened in your past, so your partner can understand your own particular sensitivities and why this is a trigger for you.
4. Accept responsibility and own up to your part in the fight.
5. Discuss how you both might do things differently the next time.
