## Defining High Sensitivity

1. Everyone, HSP or not, feels best when neither too bored nor too aroused.
2. People differ considerably in how much their nervous system is aroused in the same situation, under the same stimulation.

> Spend enough time putting yourself out there in the world - your sensitivity is not something to be feared.
