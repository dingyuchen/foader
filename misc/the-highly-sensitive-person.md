# The Highly Sensitive Person

## Defining High Sensitivity

1. Everyone, HSP or not, feels best when neither too bored nor too aroused.
2. People differ considerably in how much their nervous system is aroused in the same situation, under the same stimulation.

> Spend enough time putting yourself out there in the world - your sensitivity is not something to be feared.

## Boundaries

_Boundaries take practice!_

> They are your right, your responsibility, your greatest source of dignity.


## Falling in Love

HSPs do fall in love harder than others.

> You have fallen intensely in love, and it really has less to do with the other person and more to do with how long you have delayed reaching out.

### The Two Ingredients for Mutual Love

1. The person falling in love like certain things about the other very much
2. They found out that the other person liked them

The most arousing moments in one's life is either confessing or receiving a declaration of affection.

One excellent tactic for finding other HSPs is to ask your extraverted friends to introduce you to others they know who are like you. 
Otherwise, you can find an HSP by thinking like one.
At the risk of fostering stereotypes, HSPs might be a little more likely to show up at 
- adult education courses,
- art classes,
- lectures on Jungian psychology,
- poetry readings,
- Mensa gatherings,
- symphonies,
- opera and ballet performances,
- and spiritual retreats of all sorts.
