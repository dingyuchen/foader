# Linear Transformation

Transformation is a rule that turns **vectors** into other **vectors**.

A **Linear** Transformation is a rule that also satisfies the following rules:
$$T(c \vec u) = cT(\vec u)$$
$$T(\vec u + \vec v) = T(\vec u) + T(\vec v)$$

## Matrix of a Linear Transformation

The usual vectors $\hat i$ and $\hat j$ define a square.

## System of Linear Equations

1. If det $M \neq 0$, then there is an unique solution.
2. If det $M = 0$, there is probably no solution. But if there is one, then there will be many.

## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

Some linear transformations do not change the direction of a vector.

eg. $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & -2\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}$

In general if a transformation $T$ does not change the direction of a vector $\vec u$, that is 

$$T \vec u = \lambda \vec u$$

for some $\lambda$ (scalar), then $\vec u$ is called an **eigenvector** of $T$.
The scalar $\lambda$ is called the **eigenvalue** of $\vec u$.

### Finding Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

$$T \vec u = \lambda \vec u \Rightarrow (T - \lambda I) \vec u = \vec 0$$

Hence det$(T - \lambda I) = 0$.
This can be solved as a linear equation.

In general, there are $n$ answers for $n \times n$ matrices. (but not always!)

> Important note that eigenvectors are **not unique**. (A scalar multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector)
