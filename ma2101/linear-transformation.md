# Linear Transformation

Transformation is a rule that turns **vectors** into other **vectors**.

A **Linear** Transformation is a rule that also satisfies the following rules:
$$T(c \vec u) = cT(\vec u)$$
$$T(\vec u + \vec v) = T(\vec u) + T(\vec v)$$

## Matrix of a Linear Transformation

The usual vectors $\hat i$ and $\hat j$ define a square.
