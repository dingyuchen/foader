# Trace of a Matrix

The **trace** of $M$ denoted $TrM$, is defiend as the sum of the diagonal entries.

In general $TrMN = TrNM$.

Hence $Tr(P^{-1} A P) = Tr(A PP^{-1}) = Tr(A)$

> The trace of a matrix is always the same no matter which basis you use.

In particular for diagonalizable matrices, the trace is equal to the sum of the eigenvalues.
