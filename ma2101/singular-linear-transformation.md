# Singular Linear Transformation

Singular Linear Transformation

- Maps 2 different vectors to one vectors
- Destroys all of the vectors in at least one direction
- loses all information associated with those directions
- Satisfies det $T = 0$ 

Conversely, a **non-singular** transformation never maps 2 vectors to one.
