# Randomized Algorithms Week 1

## Intuitions about Randomness
- Breaks down some pathological inputs
  - eg Jiggling
- Makes some algorithms faster

## Issues with Analysis
- How do you measure the running time when it depends on random choices made by the algorithm?
  - Expected / average runtime
  - High probability bound on the running time
- How do you implement a random sampling?
  - How much randomness is needed?

## Examples of Random Algorithms
- [[quicksort]]
- [[treaps]] - A probabilistic binary tree
