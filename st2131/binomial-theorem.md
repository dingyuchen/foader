# Binomial Theorem

$$(x + y)^n = \sum^n_{k = 0} \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n - k}$$

## Proof
By Mathematical Induction

### Case n = 1
$$
\begin{aligned}
LHS &= x + y \\
RHS &= \binom{1}{0} y + \binom{1}{1}x \\
\therefore LHS &= RHS
\end{aligned}
$$

### Inductive Case

## Application
How many subsets are there of a set consisting of $n$ elements?

> $2^n$

\\[(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = \text{number of ways to form subset of size $k$} \\]
