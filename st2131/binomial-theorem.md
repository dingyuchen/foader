# Binomial Theorem

$$(x + y)^n = \sum^n_{k = 0} \binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n - k}$$

## Proof
By Mathematical Induction

### Case n = 1
\[
\begin{aligned}
LHS &= $x + y$ \
RHS &= 
\end{aligned}
\]

## Application
How many subsets are there of a set consisting of $n$ elements?

> $2^n$

$$(1 + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = \text{number of ways to form subset of size $k$}$$
