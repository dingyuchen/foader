# Axioms of Probability

## Preface
### Sample Space
Consider an experiment whose outcome is not predictable with certainty.

The set of all possible outcomes of the experiment is known as the _sample space_.

> Sample space can be uncountable (eg. age of a tree)
### Event
Any subset of a [sample space](#sample-space)

### Laws on Sets
- Commutative Laws
- Associative Laws
- Distributive Laws
- De Morgan's Laws

## Definition
One way of defining the probability of an event is in terms of its _relative frequency_:

$$ P(E) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \inf} \frac{n(E)}{n} $$

### Problems with this definition:
1. How do we konw that $\frac{n(E)}{n}$ will converge?
2. How do we konw that $\frac{n(E)}{n}$ will converge to the same if the experiment is repeatedly performed a second time?

### Better Axioms

Consider an experiment whose sample space is $S$. For each event $E$ of the sample space $S$, we assume that a number $P(E)$ is defined and satisfies the following 3 [[axiom]]s:

1. $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$
2. $P(S) = 1$
3. For any sequence of mutually exclusive events $E_1, E_2, ...$, $$P(\bigcup^{\infty}_{i = 1} E(i)) = \sum^{\infty}_{i = 1} P(E_i)$$

> The definitions of probability are mathematical definitions. They tell us which set functions can be called probability functions. They do not tell us the value of probability assigned to a given event.

## Strong Law of Large Numbers

If an experiment is repeated over and over again, then with probability 1, the proportion of time during which any specific event $E$ occurs will equal $P(E)$.
