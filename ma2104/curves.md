# Curves in $\R^n$

> We won't be able to define what a _curve_ is until we have developed some necessary tools about differentiation and derivatives.

- 3 usual ways of giving a curve:
  - parameterized curve
  - graph of a function
  - level set of function(s)
- For these descriptions to give a valid curve, some technical conditions have to be imposed on the inputs

## A Parameterized Curve in $\R^n$

is a function

$\vec r : I \rightarrow \R^n$ from an interval $I \subseteq \R^1$ to Euclidean n-space $\R^n$

The domain $I$ is the **parameter interval**.

The image $\vec r(I)$ of the function $\vec r$ is the **curve**.

The variable $t$ is a **parameter** for the curve.

For any $t \in I$, $\vec r(t)$ is a vector in $\R^n$,
can be written in component form and the function $\vec r : I \rightarrow \R^n$ is the same as giving $n$ many single variable functions.

If $I$ is a closed interval $a \leq t \leq b$,
- $\vec r(a)$ is the **initial point** of the curve
- $\vec r(b)$ is the **terminal point** of the curve

## Limits and Continuity

### Proposition

Suppose $\vec r : I \rightarrow \R^n$ is given in component form:

$$\vec r(t) = (r_1(t), r_2(t), ..., r_n(t))$$

Let $\vec L \in \R^n$ be given in component form as 

$$\vec L = (L_1, L_2, ..., L_n)$$

Then $\lim_{t \rightarrow t_0} \vec r(t) = \vec L$ in $\R^n$ iff $\forall j \in \{1, ..., n\}$, one has $\lim_{t \rightarrow t_0} r_j(t) = \vec L_j$ in $\R$.

> We can apply analysis for one-dimension component-wise to proof properties of vector functions

#### Proof

In general, if $\vec v = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n) \in \R^n$

## Derivatives

Let $t \in I$ be given. Say $\vec r$ is differentiable at $t$ iff $\exists \vec r'(t) \in \R^n$ such that

$$ \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t}(\vec r (t + \Delta t) - \vec r (t)) = \vec r'(t)$$

Then $\vec r'(t)$ is the (vector-)derivative of $\vec r$ at $t$.

> $\vec r$ is differentiable at $t$ if all its component functions are differentiable at $t$.

### Differentiation Rules

Let $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ be differentiable vector functions of $t$, $\vec C$ a constant vector function, $c$ any scalar, and $f$ any differentiable scalar function.

1. $\frac{d}{dt} \vec C = \vec 0$
2. $\frac{d}{dt} [c \vec u (t)]= c \vec u'(t)$
3. $\frac{d}{dt} [f(t) \vec u (t)]= f'(t) \vec u(t) + f(t) \vec u'(t)$
4. $\frac{d}{dt} [\vec u (t) + \vec v(t)]= \vec u'(t) + \vec v'(t)$
5. $\frac{d}{dt} [\vec u (t) \cdot \vec v(t)]= \vec u'(t) \cdot \vec v (t) + \vec u(t) \cdot \vec v'(t)$
6. $\frac{d}{dt} [\vec u (f(t))]= f'(t) \vec u'(f(t))$
7. $\frac{d}{dt} [\vec u (t) \times \vec v(t)]= \vec u'(t) \times \vec v (t) + \vec u(t) \times \vec v'(t)$

## Integrals

[[todo]]

Rieman definition of integrals transposed to $\R^n$.

## More definitions

$\vec r$ is continuously differentiable ("of class $C^1$") iff $\vec r$ is differentiable and $\vec r' : I \rightarrow \R^n$ is continuous.

----------

The parameterized curve given by $\vec r$ is **smooth** iff $\vec r$ is continuously differentiable and has [[non-vanishing-derivative]]s.

> "smooth" has a different technical definition in analysis, geometry, etc.

----------

The parameterized curve given by $\vec r : I \rightarrow \R^n$ is piecewise smooth iff $\vec r$ is continuous,

and exists a partition of the interval $I = [a, b]$, say 

$$a = t_0 < t_1 < ... < t_{n - 1} < t_n = b$$

such that $\forall j \in {1, ..., n}$, $\vec r$ restricted to $[t_{j - 1}, t_j]$ is smooth.

> Thus $\vec r$ is allowed to be non-differentiable at the partition points $\vec r(t_1), \vec r(t_2), ..., \vec r(t_n)$ 

## Arc Length

Let $I = [a, b] \subseteq \R'$ be a closed interval.

Let $\vec r : I \rightarrow \R^n$ be a smooth parameterized curve in $\R^n$.

The length of the curve parameterized by $\vec r$ is defined to be the integral 

$$\int^b_a \vert \vec r '(t) \vert \, dt$$

> If $\vec r$ is piecewise smooth, its length is defined to be the sum of the length of its smooth pieces.

### Remark

Why is this definition of length reasonable?

- Take a line segment in $\R^n$. Note that integration length agrees with the _Euclidean space length_ of the vector represented by that line segment.
