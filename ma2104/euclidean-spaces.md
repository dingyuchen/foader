# Euclidean Spaces

Fix a natural number $n \in \N$.

Set $\R^n := \R \times \R \times ... \times \R :=$ { all ordered $n$-tuples } 
called the standard ($n$-dimensional) vector space (over $\R$)

- $n$ is called the dimension of $\R^n$
- elements of $\R^n$ are called vectors, points, $n$-tuples
- elements of $\R$ are called scalars
- if $\vec \mathbf{u} \in \R^n$ is a vector,
then for each $i = 1, ..., n$, we call $u_i$ the $i^{th}$ component
- the vector $\vec 0 := (0, ..., 0)$ is the zero vector (origin)

## Vectors

### Operations on Vectors

- Addition 
  - add vectors componentwise
- Negation
  - apply distributively
- Scalar multiplication
  - apply distributively

### Dot Product

$\cdot : \R^n \times \R^n$

$$\vec u \cdot \vec v = \sum^n_{i = 1} u_i v_i$$

#### Properties of Dot Product

1. Symmetric
2. Commutative
3. Associative w.r.t. scalar multiplication
4. Distributive
5. $\vec u \cdot \vec u = | \vec u |^2$
6. $\vec 0 \cdot \vec u = 0$
