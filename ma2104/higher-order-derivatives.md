# Higher Order Derivatives

## Twice Continuously Differentiable

Say $f$ is twice continuously differentiable iff $f$ is differentiable on $R$
and $f'$ is differentiable as a function $R \rightarrow \mathbb{M}_{n \times m}$.

In general, say $f$ is of class $C^0$ iff $f$ is continuous.

For $r \geq 1$, say $f$ is of class $C^r$ iff $f$ is differentiable on $R$ and $f'$ is of class $C^{r - 1}$.

## Characterization of Continuous Differentiability

A function $f: R \rightarrow \R^n$, is of class $C^r$ iff 
for each $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$ , for each $j \in \{1, ..., m\}$,
for all $\vec p_0 \in R$,
the $j^{th}$ partial derivative $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(\vec p_0)$ of $f_i$ at $\vec p_0$ exists,
and the function $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j} : R \rightarrow \R$ is of class $C^{r-1}$.

----------

### Notation

$$ \frac{\partial^r f_i}{\partial x_{j_d} \partial x_{j_{d-1}}...\partial x_{j_1}} := \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{j_d}} \bigg (\frac{\partial^{r-1}f_i}{\partial x_{j_{d - 1}}... \partial x_{j_1}} \bigg ) := ({f_i})_{x_{j_1}...x_{j_d}}$$

> Note the reverse in pattern

----------

$f : R \rightarrow \R^n$ is of class $C^r$ iff
for each $i \in \{1, ..., n\}$ , for each $j \in \{1, ..., m\}$,

the function $(f_i)_{x_{j_1}...x_{j_r}} : R \rightarrow \R$ exists and is continuous.

## Equality of Mixed Partial Derivatives

> The indices can be in any order, the partial derivative will be the same.

### Proof

Requires [[mean-value-theorem]], which is not in the scope of this module.

## Taylor's Theorem for Multivariables

----------

Recall [[taylors-theorem]]

### Remainder Estimation Theorem

[[remainder-estimation-theorem]]

----------

Let $f: R \rightarrow \R$ be a (scalar-valued) function on $R$ open in $\R^m$ of class $C^{r + 1}$ ($r \geq 1$).

Let $\vec p_0 \in R$, and suppose $\delta \in \R_{> 0}$, such that $B_{\R^m}(\vec p_0, \delta) \subseteq R$

Then $\forall \vec \xi \in \R^m$ with $\vert \vec \xi \vert < \delta$, one has

$$ f(\vec p_0 + \vec \xi) = \sum^e_{d = 0} \sum_{\alpha \in \N, \vert \alpha \vert = d} \frac{1}{\alpha !} \frac{\partial^d f}{\partial x_1^{\alpha_1} ...\partial x_m^{\alpha_m}} (\vec p_0) \cdot \xi_1^{\alpha_1} ... \xi_m^{\alpha_m} + R(\vec \xi)$$

> sum over degrees $d$ up to $r$

where $\alpha = (\alpha_1, ..., \alpha_m) \in \Z^m_{\geq 0}$

$\vert \alpha \vert = \alpha_1 + ... + \alpha_m$

$\alpha ! = \alpha_1 ! + ... + \alpha_m !$
