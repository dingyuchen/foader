# Remainder Estimation Theorem

If there is a positive constant $M$ such that $\vert f^{(n + 1)}(c) \vert \leq M$
for all $t$ between $x$ and $a$, inclusive, then the remainder term $R_n(x)$ in [[taylors-theorem]] satisfies the inequality

$$\vert R_n(x) \leq M \frac{\vert x - a \vert ^{n + 1}}{(n + 1)!}$$
