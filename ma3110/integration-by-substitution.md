# Integration by Substitution

Suppose that the functions $\phi : [a, b] \rightarrow \R$ is such that $\phi'$ exists and is integrable on $[a, b]$.

If $f:I \rightarrow \R$ is continuous on an interval $I$ containing $\phi([a, b])$, then

$$\int^b_a f(\phi(t))\phi'(t) dt = \int^{\phi(b)}_{\phi(a)} f(x) dx$$

## Proof
