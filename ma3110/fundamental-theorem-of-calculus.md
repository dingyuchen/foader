## Indefinite Integral 

Let $f: [a, b] \rightarrow \R$ be integrable on $[a, b]$.

For each $x \in (a, b]$, $f$ is integrable on $[a, x]$. Define

$$F(x) =\int^x_a f$$

We also define 

$$F(a) =\int^x_a f = 0$$

The function $F: [a, b] \rightarrow \R$ is called the **indefinite integral** of $f$ with base point $a$.

## Theorem 7.3.1

The indefinite integral $F$ of $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$.

### Proof

Let $M > 0$ be such that $\vert f(x) \vert \leq M \; \forall x \in [a, b]$

For $x, y \in [a, b], x < y$

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
  \vert F(x) - F(y) \vert & = \vert \int^x_a f - \int^y_a f \vert \\
  & = \vert \int^x_a f - (\int^x_a f + \int^y_x f) \vert \\
  & = \vert \int^y_x f \vert \\
  & \leq \int^y_x \vert f \vert \\
  & \leq \int^y_x M \\
  & = M(y-x) = M \vert x - y \vert \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $\epsilon > 0$. Choose $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{M}$.

Then $\vert x - y \vert < \delta \implies \vert F(x) - F(y) \vert < M \delta = \epsilon$

----------

Is $F$ differentiable?

> only if $f$ is continuous

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 1

Let $f$ be integrable on $[a, b]$ and let 

$$F(x) = \int^x_a f$$

If $f$ is continuous at a point $c \in [a, b]$ then $F$ is differentiable at $c$ and

$$ F'(c) = f(c)$$

### Proof

Let $\epsilon > 0$.

## Corollary 7.3.3

If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then the indefinite integral $F$ is differentiable on $[a, b]$ and

$$ F'(x) = f(x) \; \forall x \in [a, b]$$

> Think of integration as an upgrading process to make a continuous function differentiable.

If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then its indefinite integral $F$ is an **antiderivative** of $f$

$$F' = f$$

----------

## Summary

If $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$, then the indefinite integral is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$.

But $F$ may not be differentiable.

$F$ is differentiable if $f$ is continuous.

----------

## Corollary 7.3.4

If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $g$ be differentiable on $[c, d]$, where $g([c, d]) \subseteq [a, b]$. Then the function

$$G(x) = \int^{g(x)}_a f, \; \; x\in [c, d]$$

is differentiable on $[c, d]$ and

$$G'(x) = f(g(x))g'(x), \; \; \forall x\in [c, d]$$

----------

Consider $F \circ g : [c, d] \rightarrow \R$

$$
\begin{aligned}
  (F \circ g)(x) & = F(g(x)) \\
      & = \int^{g(x)}_a f \\
      & = G(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $f$ is continuous $\implies F$ is differentiable. Apply Chain Rule.

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 2

Let $g$ be differentiable on $[a, b]$ and assume that $g'$ is continuous on $[a, b]$. Then

$$ \int^b_a g' = g(b) - g(a) $$

### Proof

Since $g'$ is continuous (assumption)... [[todo]]
