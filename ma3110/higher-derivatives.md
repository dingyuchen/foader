# Higher Derivatives

If $f$ is differentiable on an interval $I$, then its derivative $f'$ is a function on $I$.

So we can consider the differentiability of $f'$.

If $c \in I$ and $f'$ is differentiable at $c$, then we call the derivative of $f'$ at $c$ the **second derivative** of $f$ a $c$ and denote it by $f''(c)$ or $f^{(2)}(c)$. 
That is,

$$f''(c) := (f')'(c)$$

In general, if $n \in \N$, then the nth derivative $f^{(n)}(c)$ of $f$ at $c$ is defined as

$$f^{(n)}(c) := (f^{(n-1)})'(c)$$

So $f^{(n)}(c)$ exists if $(f^{(n-1)})'(c)$ exists in a neighborhood of $c$, and $f^(n-1)$ is differentiable at $c$.

## Notation

Let $I$ be an interval.

1. For $n \in \N$, let 

$$ C^n(I) = \{ f: f^{(n)} \text{ exists and is continuous on } I \}$$
2. Let
$$C^\infty (I) = \{ f: f^{(n)} \text{ exists and is continuous on } I \forall n \in \N \} = \bigcap^\infty_{n = 1} C^n(I)$$

If $f \in C^\infty(I)$, then we say that $f$ if **infinitely differentiable** on $I$.

> $C^0(I)$ or $C(I)$ is the collection of all continuous functions on $I$.

### Exercise

----------

By [[mean-value-theorem]], we have some $c_0 \in (a, x_0)$ and $c_1 \in (x_0, b)$ where $f'(c_1) = f'(c_2) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$.

Applying [[rolles-theorem]] we have $c \in (c_0, c_1)$ where $f''(c) = 0$.

## Second Derivative Test

Let $f$ be defined on an interval $I$ and let its derivative $f'$ exists on $I$.

Suppose that $c$ is an interior point of $I$ such that 
$f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c)$ exists

1. If $f''(c) > 0$, then $f$ has a relative minimum at $c$.
2. If $f''(c) < 0$, then $f$ has a relative maximum at $c$.

> Nothing is said for $f''(c) = 0$.

### Proof

Apply [[ma3110-lemma-631]] to $f'$ for _(1)_.

Then we know that $f'(x) < f'(c) = 0$ for $x < c$ and vice versa.

By the [[first-derivative-test]], $f$ has a relative minimum at $c$.

## L'Hopital's Rule

## Taylor's Theorem

[[taylors-theorem]]

### Applications

If $n = 0$, then by [[taylors-theorem]],

$$f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(c)(x - x_0)$$

that is,

$$f'(c) = \frac{f(x) - f(x_0)}{x - x_0}$$

So Taylor's Theorem can be regarded as an extension of the [[mean-value-theorem]].

----------

If $n = 1$,

$$f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x - x_0)^2$$

----------

The polynomial

$$P_n(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) + \frac{f''(c)}{2!}(x - x_0)^2 + ... + \frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x - x_0)^n$$

is called the **nth Taylor polynomial** for $f$ at $x_0$.

It has the property that

$$P_n^{(j)}(x_0) = f^{(j)}(x_0)\, \text{ for } j = 0, 1, 2, ..., n$$

Taylor's Theorem give us the error (or remainder) of this estimation:

$$R_n(x) := f(x) - P_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n + 1)}(c)}{(n + 1)!}(x - x_0)^{n + 1}$$

The formula for $R_n$ is called the **Lagrange form** (or the **derivative form**) of the remainder.

#### Using Taylor's Series to prove Inequality

If we know that $R_n(x) \geq 0$, then $f(x) \geq P_n(x)$.

e.g. $\cos x = 1 - \frac{x^2}{x} + R_2(x) \geq 1 - \frac{x^2}{2}$
