# First Derivative Test

Let $f$ be continuous on $[a, b]$ and $c \in (a, b)$. 
Suppose that f is differentiable on $(a, b)$ except possibly at $c$.

1. If there is a neighborhood $(c - \delta, c + \delta) \subseteq I$ of $c$ such that $f'(x) \geq 0$ such that for $x \in (c - \delta, c)$ and $f'(x) \leq 0$ for $x \in (c, c + \delta)$, then 
$$f(c) \geq f(x), \, \forall x \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)$$
Hence $f$ has a relative maximum at $c$.

2. vice versa for relative minimum.
