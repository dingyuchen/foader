## Limits of functions
Roughly speaking, a function $f$ has a limit $L$ at the point $x = a$ if 
$$x \approx a \Rightarrow f(x) \approx L$$

## Chain Rule

$$(g \circ f)' (a) = g'(f(a))f'(a)$$

$$\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}$$

The derivative of a composite function is the derivative of the outer function with respect to the inner function multiplied by derivative of the inner function w.r.t. $x$.

## Inverse Function Theorem

## Mean Value Theorem and Applications

### Definitions

Let $I$ be an interval, $f : I \rightarrow \real$ and $x_0 \in I$.

1. We say that $f(x_0)$ is the **absolute maximum** of $f$ on $I$ if $f(x_0) \geq f(x)$ for all $x \in I$.
2. We say that $f(x_0)$ is the **relative maximum** of $f$ on $I$ if there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \in (x_0 - \delta, x_0 + \delta) \subseteq I$, $f(x_0) \geq f(x)$.

> There can be no absolute maximum, eg. $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ on $(0, 1)$, however, [[extreme-value-theorem]] states that there definitely exists an absolute maximum in **closed** interval.

**Absolute minimum** and **relative minimum** is defined similarly.

- We say $f(x_0)$ is a **relative extremum** of $f$ if $f(x_0)$ is either a relative maximum or minimum.

> A relative extremum can only occur at an [[interior-point]], but an absolute extremum can occur at the end points of the interval.
>
> So if a function has an absolute maximum point at $x_0$, it is not guaranteed to also have a relative maximum at $x_0$.

#### Lemma 6.3.1

Let $f: (a, b) \rightarrow \real$ and $f'(c)$ exists for some $c \in (a, b)$.

If $f'(c) > 0$
