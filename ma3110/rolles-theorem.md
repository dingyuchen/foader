# Rolle's Theorem

If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$ and $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that
$$f'(c) = 0$$

## Proof
### Case 1: $f$ is a constant function
Then $f'(x) = 0$ for all $x \in (a, b)$.

> Trivial case

### Case 2: $f$ is **not** a constant function
By [[mean-value-theorem]], there exists $x_1,x_2 \in [a, b]$ such that 

$$f(x_1) \leq f(x) \leq f(x_2)$$,

$\forall x \in [a, b]$.

Since $f$ is not a constant function, $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$.

Since $f(a) = f(b)$, at least one of $x_1, x_2$ is in $(a, b)$, and we call this point $c$.

So $f$ has an absolute extremum at $c \in (a, b)$.

In particular, $f$ has a relative extremum at $c$.

By the [[interior-extremum-theorem]], $f'(c) = 0$.
