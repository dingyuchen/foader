# Mean Value Theorem

If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$ and $f(a) = f(b)$, then there exists $c \in (a, b)$ such that
$$f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

 > There must be some point $c$ where the tangent to that point is parallel to the gradient between the ends of the interval.
