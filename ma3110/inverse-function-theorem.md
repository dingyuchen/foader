# Inverse Function Theorem

Let $I$ be an interval, and let $f : I \rightarrow \real$ be strictly monotone and continuous on $I$.

Let $J := f(I)$ and let $g : J \rightarrow \real$ be the _inverse function of $f$_. 

If $f$ is differentiable at $c \in I$ and $f'(c) \neq 0$, then $g$ is differentiable at $d := f(c)$ and 

$$g'(d) = \frac{1}{f'(c)}$$

## Intuition

Differentiating $y$ w.r.t. $x$,

$$\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{\frac{dy}{dx}}$$
